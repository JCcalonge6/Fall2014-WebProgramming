                                                Fitness Tracker Specifications

The driving force for any successful application is how useful and practical its users think it is. I, as an 
application user, have an idea of what a good fitness tracker should do and function but in order to make a 
more successful fitness app I asked other people. In order to get more ideas I asked my mom and certain friends 
who really care about fitness and health. I got a lot of ideas from them and the list below lists ideas we had. 
Although it looks simple now I feel this is a great list to work with as later ideas can be implanted as the work progresses.

-----------------
Input of Exercise
-----------------
This is one of the most controversial ideas we had as it got the same concern. It is all based on the honor system 
that you actually did the exercise. The tracker has no way of tracking if you actually did the exercises you input 
into it. A couple of solutions were found such as it having connectivity through your smartphone or a fitness 
wristband. Only problem I told them is that I am not really sure if I have the time or ability to do that. If possible 
this could be a possibility to explore further. For now we will stick to the honor system policy.

-------------
Input of Food
-------------
This had the same issue as the input of exercise but there is no current way to track what a person eats.

-----------------------------
Calculation of Exercise Stats
-----------------------------
Even though everybodyâ€™s body burns different amount of calories for the activities they do, we can do an average 
calorie burn for the inputted exercise. 

--------------
Chart Creation
--------------
This feature will make a chart for the amount of calories ingested and burned daily. This will allow the user to 
see how effective their diet and exercise program is.

--------------------
Ability to put Goals
--------------------
This will allow the user to input weekly and monthly goals. With this feature the user will have something to stride towards.

------------
Weight Input
------------
Along with the chart creation and the goal feature, the user should be able to have a chart comparing their weight to 
their goal weight.

----------
Daily tips
----------
Have a daily health tip whether it is for exercise or food.

----------
Motivation
----------
In my life I learned a very valuable lesson:

Life doesn't always want to be your friend but you can't just hide because no body likes a quitter. You gotta take chances.
Nobody said it was going to be fun or easy. Whether you're totally ready or when you least expect it. Doesn't matter. 
Life will punch you right in the face. You can lie there for a second. Cry a little if you need to. But get back on your
feet 'cause its the getting back up that counts. That's what shows you've got heart. That's what helps keep you going. Fall
down seven times, get up eight. And if you ever need support, don't forget to look in your corner because there always
someone there cheering you on.

Just like life, a healthy lifestyle is no easy feat. People fall and quit all the time because its so difficult. This feature
will motivate the user by giving them positive feedback. Whether they lost 1 pound or 10, by giving the user a "Way to go!
You're awesome! Keep up the great work :D" the user will be encouraged. Even if this only increases the likely hood of
them staying on track by a small chance, that small chance can make a big difference. Trust me, I've faced tons of 
"impossible" feats in my life before.

This will be the most important feature in making a truly successful fitness app.
